# Rules-of-Conduct
The Rules of Conduct, required reading. These rules must be UPHELD by any member of the organization.

1. We will not make the same mistakes as GCE, or Timeless. If a tyrant has taken total control, we are in our right to remove them as fast as possible, without warning. Even if it means we MUST move to another organization and let the tyrant rot along with old copies of source code.
2. If a user is blocked from the repo, they will REMAIN blocked until we decide to change our minds.
3. We are not to fuse as many mods as possible into one unholy abomination. Most players like it when a mod is not forced together with five billion others into an unholy chimera.
4. No paid benefits in any mod. Look at Vazkii's patreon page if you want examples of what is okay for donation perks.
5. Drama must be shut down fast, and dealt with swiftly.
6. There is to be no enforcing of harsh rules on a mod to get at a specific member.
7. Do not place malicious code in any mod, even if it seems tempting. You will be removed and blocked if you do so. NO EXCEPTIONS.
8. We are to listen to the community for feedback. Everyone has a voice, waiting to be heard.
9. If another member attempts to harass another user, even if they are unrelated to this organization, via the real world, for issues relating to this organization and its internal affairs, they will be removed of all power and reprimanded. Keep this via the internet, not the real world. We don't want innocents to get involved with our drama. Phone calls, mail and real world confrontations are examples of harassment via the real world. In addition, if such situations are bad enough, we encourage anyone who is the target of such a member to call the authorities.
10. All users must comply with the EULA of Minecraft.
11. Apply common sense where the rules seem to lack or check back with the team.
12. No user is to be rushed in making content, even if they have been behind. Rushed content is the bane of all.
